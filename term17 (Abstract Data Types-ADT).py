# Abstract Data Types (ADT)

# Short info:

# if we want to store a data in our machine we have to use a certain datatype.
# datatypes can be both simple(primitive) and complex.
# in programming, normally we have huge amount of data and we want to put them together.
# we can combine them in abstract datatypes like list, stack, queue, map.
# they called abstract because they are concepts which are found in almost every language.
# in different language we have different implementation for this adt.


# Detail info:

# what is data structure?
# In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management and storage format
# that enables efficient access and modification.

# we can understand data structures in 2 methods:
# mathematical/ logical/ abstract models/ views
# implementation

# What is ADT?
# Adts are entitis that are definitions of data and operations but do not have implementation details.
# it means we know what and how data we are going to storing, what methods and operations we can do on that data,
# how will we fetch or access data from those data types.
# but we haven't yet implemented it in any practical sense.

# the reason we do not have any implementaion because every different language have different way to implement those data types.
# for example, when we have to store data which have a name and values,
# we can use structures in c, classes in java, dictionaries and classes in python.
# it means the implementation view vary from language to language but the logical views are same.
