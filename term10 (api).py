# API
# Application Programming Interface

# connectivity is an amaging thing. we are connected to the world. but how?
# how different datbases and applicationas connect each other?
# how it allows us to place an order, book a flight in juct a moment?
# the hero behind this connectivity is called API.
# it is the engine under the hood. it makes all possible of that possibility that we are relive on.

# exactly what is an API?
# WIKIPEDIA says that,
# Application programming interface. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
# An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of functions, procedures, methods or classes 
# used by computer programs to request services from the operating system, software libraries 
# or any other service providers running on the computer.

# to speak frankly API is the messager to take request and tell the system what you want to do.
# and then return the response back to us.

# we can think of an API as an waiter of a restaurant.
# we have a menu where we can order many decies and kitchen is the system which prepares the order for us.
# what is missing is the connection to our order to the kitchen and deliver our food back to our table.
# thats what a waiter or API does.
# the waiter is the messenger eho tells our respons to the system in this case to the kitchen 
# and deliver our order from the system.
# so API is the interface between us and the system and it also hide all the complexity for us.  
# it also allows different programs to work with one another without much hesitation. 

# ther are lots of real world example of API
# we re pobably femiliar with the air ticket booking sites online.
# just like a restaurant we have a menu to choose our comfortable seat in a comfortable flight and time.
# in order to book our flight we inerect with the database of the website.
# what if we are not using a direct website of perticuler flight?
# what if we are using a travel agency to buy our tickets?
# this travel agency connects with the databases of many airlines.
# the travel service interects with the airlines API.
# the API's receive the prder from us and connects the airlines database
# and also send the feedback to the online travel setvice when then shows to us.

# now we can see, API is the main reason why we are able to connect to the whole worlds informations, data and devices.
# they all have API's that allows computers to co-operate with them.
# and that this the connectivity.
# so whenever we think API's, we should think it as a waiter running between applications and databases, devices and systems with bunch of information and instructions.
 
# there are lots of usecase of API. lets see some of them.

# ACCESS DATA
# waiter provide us the data without us to going to the kitchen by our self.
# google and apples temprature forecast. they use tempreture forecast of third party softwares by APIs.
# this days there is hardly any online service which doesn't access data by API.

# HIDE COMPLEXICITY
# in the restaurant we dont need to know how to make a nice soup.
# operating system of our pc and phone.
# software developers dont have to worry about how to set up a wifi connection, how gps works,
# how os create a beutiful interfase or how to talk with various sensors?
# instead of operating system gives the developers bunch of API's.
# if an app is installed, it asks the API to put a symble of that app in the screen.
# it dont have to know all the equation behind it, what os it is running, what the resolution etc etc.
# all this API do for us. it makes developer more efficient and focus on their real world.

# EXTEND FUNCTIONALITY
# siri, google assistent, alexa they ar clever.
# extarnal developers can use the APIs of this assistans to extend the functionality.
# google assistant dont know how to turn smart lights on and off.
# but that change when a verder interects with google assistent through its API.
# we might not realize but API's all around us.

# SECURITY
# API;s works as the gate-keeper for different purposes.
# we might find messages like this. our phone asking permission for different softwares.
# it is not the softwares being polite to ask us before they use our resources,
# it is the API of phone which reminds us about one third party software is trying to get the access of our resources.
# the system also give us the ability to give or deny the permissions at later time.
# so everytime our phone gives us these type of notification
# we know that some app is trying to use the API's of our system and one of tham is privacy sensitive.
