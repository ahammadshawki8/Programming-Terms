# module 12
# 20 different useful programming acronyms and terms

# ajax/xhar:
# they sometimes conflict to mean same thing but they aren't
    # ajax = asynchronous javascript and xml.
    # generic concept involving transferring xml via javascript async.
    
    # xhr = xml http request (XMLHttpRequest)
    # javascript object facilitating async requests
    # xhr can be thought of a implementation of ajax.
    # but one little problem,
    # is not just xml as the name so wrongfully implies 

#  backend:
    # in the web context, refers to server side code and logic.
    # for everything else, refers to underlying code and logic.
    # if we have a desktop application we may refer the underlying code as the backend of that application.

# frontend:
    # refers to the portion of a program the user interacts with.
    # this is the converse of backend.
    # frontend refres to web interface, terminal interface, desktop program and so on.

# the cloud:
    # refers to vertual macj=hine and other services rented to the public.
    # the cloud hides the idea of hardware pretty much entirely.
    # clouds are typically the services that hosts by large vendors like google, amajon, microsoft, facebook, dropbox etc.

# compiler:
    # a software that converts human readable code to machine code. 
    # a compiler is actually a tool that took human readable code, then turns it to a assembly,
    # then assembles assembly into an object code, and then links that object code into an executable.

#  transpiler:
    # simmilar to compiler, but change human readable code into other human readable code.
    # exp. typescript with transpile to javascript.

# editor:
    # a program used to edit code "without integration".
    # without integration is important because IDE edit code with integration.
    # an editor can thought as a strip down IDE.
    # exp. atom dev, vscode, vim, nano etc.

# IDE:
    # integrated development environment
    # contains everything an editor does.
    # but also integrates with other things (database, test runner etc.)
    # one most common examples of ide's when we use database,
    # imagine we are typing up queries in our project, but it auto completing the actual fields from our actual database.
    # it is a way we get smart auto complete inside our project directly from the database.

# Integration
    # Integration is the act of bringing together smaller components into a single system that functions as one. 
    # Integration is harder to achieve the greater the number of systems that are involved and 
    # companies often choose to have external contractors manage some or all phases of the development of the new system.

# cron:
    # gets name from greek god chronos.
    # it is the most common method of running code at sheduled times.
    # cronjobs (commands) are scheduled inside s crontab (list ob commands)
    # it is a linux thing.

# devops:
    # devops = development operations
    # refers to teams that bridge the gap between development and IT concerns.
    # often times it can be held by enginners with some IT experience or IT professionals with some enginnering experience.

# encription:
    # refers to a process of converting data to scrambled data.
    # uses a key to determine how to scramble.
    # can be reversed(unscramble) with the same key. 

# hash:
    # refers toa process of converting data to a fixed set of characters.
    # avalanche effect is a property of hash.
    # it means basically if we change a set of data by even one bit, it changes the hash entirely.
    # cannot be reversed however they can be broken by precomputed tables as well as brute force.
    # lot of times, people misunderstand hashing with encryption.
    # but hashing is only one way.
    # some hashes are mb5, sha1. sha2, bcrypt

# glue code:
    # most commonly refers to new code acting as an adapter to old code.
    # we need to have lot of glue codes to upgrade piece of software or to interect with the legacey software.
    # we need to glue code to link two sets of code old one and new one.

# json:
    # json = javascript object notation
    # refers to the generic  collections of data used for storing, transporting and other purposes.
    # it is also fully compitable with javascript without any modification.
    # we can copy and paste json in javascript and it will work everytime.

# low level/high level language:
    # not about how good it is
    # low level refers to a language that is closer to the hardware.
    # high level refers to a language that is more abstracted and hides much if not all low level interaction.
    # low level languages are assembly, lower etc.
    # high label languages are python, C, higher etc.
    # in 1970s C was really high level language.
    # but in 2020, when python has occured it is the super high level language wich makes C a lower one.

# regex:
    # regex = regular expressions.
    # refers to a pattern making and text processing syntax.

# repl:
    # repl = read-eval-print-loop
    # refers to an interective interpreteur at a language which takes a line of code,
    # processes it, prints the result and then repeats
    # the way we access a repl intrepreteur to commonwise is just run python with no arguements or node with no arguements.
    # this will give us the python and node shell.
    # from their we can import a line of code and process it and return optional results and it will repeat if we do it again.

# source control:
    # refers to various software responsible for storing change history of files and
    # facilities the simple collaboration with other developers.
    # exp. git, mercurial, perforce, tfs, and less commonly svn and cvs.

# vm:
    # vm = virtual machine
    # refers to a typically linux machine running sandboxed within another linux machine.
    # another common term which simmilar with it is virtualise server.
